# DBMS
DBMS provides the method to store and access the data more efficiently as compared to the file system

# File System Disadvantages | DBMS Advantages
1. Data redundancy and inconsistency
2. difficulty in accessing data
3. data isolation 
4. integrity problems
5. atomicity problems [Either the trancaction will be be completed or not no middle state]
6. concurrent access anomalies [For eg traction is made from phone and debit card at the same time so to handle concurrent requests] 
7. security problems [restricting access to the Database]

# DBMS provides the abstraction to database in the form of 3 schema[design] architecture
- Physical Level : focuses upon how the data is stored [stored in the form of bits/bytes] and accessed,implementing different techniques like encryption,decryption,compression decompression etc
for eg. Student data containing student details [name,adress,age,branch,year] stored seperated by comma or csv
- Logical Level : convert the raw data in the understandable format  [Physical level to logical level mapping , Done using logical schema]
for eg. This raw student data converted into table with proper columns and rows which make the data understandable
Also if their is some other data like course info [courseId,courseName] now the relationship can be built at logical level not at the physical level eg. student is enrolled in this course
- View Level / External Level : Highest level of abstraction,used by the end user,in this we have view schema in which only some part of the information/db is visible/accessable to the viewers depending upon their task and rest is hidden.
At this level the security mechanism is applied to prevent the users to access the certain parts of the DB

How the host languages like java ,c,c++ interact with database?
Ans. Through the Application programming interface. In java application an sql query written in some data structure sent through JDBC(Java database connectivity) to SQL server (DBMS) . JDBC basically transforms the sql query packet/string to the actual sql query and hence it is interpreted by the sql server and send back the response which is again transformed to some java format by jdbc and data received to the host application.

# DataBase Administrator
A person having the central control of the whole database. Works at the logical level

# DataBase Application Architecture
- Tier 1 : Here the client,server [local host] and db are present on the same computer.
- Tier 2 : Here you send the wrapped sql query directly from client side through JDBC to the server
- Tier 3 : Main advantage [Application Server] filter out the queries that are vulnerable or can corrupt the database
Here 3 levels clientSide -> Application server -> Database
This architecture is best for the www applications  
- Advantages:
    - Scalability 
    - Data Integrity 
    - Security
